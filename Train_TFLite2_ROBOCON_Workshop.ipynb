        "This notebook uses [the TensorFlow 2 Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) to train an SSD-MobileNet model or EfficientDet model with a custom dataset and convert it to TensorFlow Lite format. By working through this Colab, you'll be able to create and download a TFLite model that you can run on your PC, an Android phone, or an edge device like the Raspberry Pi.\n",

It comes with most TensorFlow backend requirements (like CUDA and cuDNN) pre-installed. Simply click the play button on sections of code in this notebook to execute them on the virtual machine.\n",
